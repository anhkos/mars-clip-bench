"""
Vision-class anchors — adapted from lumin_mining/anchors.py for the retrieval-benchmark side
of the project.

The KG tool's anchors are PDS4 schema concepts ("southern summer" -> a Ls-degree range). These
anchors are visual/geological classes from the actual MSL and HiRISE label sets, and the goal
isn't a schema filter — it's a real sentence from a real paper that describes what the class
looks like, to use as an authentic (non-template) retrieval query.

Same underlying principle as the original anchors.py: anchor searches on something distinctive
that a paper would actually contain, not a bare generic word that floods ADS with noise. Most
of the MSL class names ARE bare generic words (Ground, Wheel, Horizon, Scoop...), so this module
leans harder on the "generic word needs a qualifier" guard than the KG version did.

KNOWN GAP: this file uses class NAMES, not the numeric class_label IDs your manifest.csv uses.
Before merging mined rows into queries.csv, map these names to your manifest's actual IDs by
checking msl_synset_words-indexed.txt from the MSL dataset (Zenodo record 1049137) — do not
assume alphabetical order matches your label encoding, that's exactly the kind of unverified
assumption this project exists to catch.

# MSL — 24 classes, confirmed against Wagstaff et al. 2018 ("Deep Mars: CNN Classification of
# Mars Imagery for the PDS Imaging Atlas"), Figure 1 — the same v1/6,691-image/24-class dataset
# the original LUMIN paper cites (Zenodo 1049137). This is the rover-hardware-focused set, NOT
# the newer 19-class science-target set (Lu & Wagstaff 2020) — don't mix the two up if you see
# other MSL class lists online, several exist.
#
# These are almost all rover hardware/instrument names, which is exactly the coverage gap
# hypothesis from earlier: there may not be much natural "here's what this looks like" language
# about a drill or a wheel in the literature the way there is for geological features. If this
# comes back much thinner than HiRISE's, that's a finding, not a bug.
